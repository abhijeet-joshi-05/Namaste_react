if you want to build a app ! 
1st step Planning !!

Props !! 
Short for properties when we want to dynamically pass data to component we can pass it as props !

Props are just normal arguments to our function 

passing a prop to a function is just like 
passing a argument to our function 

<ResCard
  resName="Meghana Foods"
  cuisine="Biryani, North Indian, Asian"
/>
in this resName and cuisine are props and process of doing it passing props to a function component

Again PROPS ARE USED WHEN WE WANT TO PASS DATA DYNAMICALLY TO FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS

Never Use index as key for props 

unique id(best practice) >>>> index as key >>>> not using keys(its just not acceptable )
